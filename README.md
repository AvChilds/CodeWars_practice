## 🥇 Current Rank: 7kyu – Python Path

I’m currently working my way through **Python katas**, solving bite-sized challenges to level up my problem-solving skills.

🧩 **Kata** = brainy puzzle  
🥋 **Kyu** = coder rank (lower = stronger!)  
🛤️ Goal: Keep climbing from 7kyu → 1kyu… then start over as a ninja with **dan** ranks!
